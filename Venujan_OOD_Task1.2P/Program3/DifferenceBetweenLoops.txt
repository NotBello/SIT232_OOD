Although do while loops, while loops and for loops appear to perform and produce the same output. 
They are not the same. 

The while loops can perform iterations unitl the given condition is assigned as false. 
This results in dynamically looping through events, items, etc without knowing their size or limit.
This type of loop is especially helpful in input validation as shown in the console application

The do while loop is similar to that of the while loops. But the single notable difference is that minimum number of execution.
The do while loop statement performs an iteration atleast once before checking for the condition. 
This is helpful incases where the logic had to be deployed once to be useful in the following iterations.

The for loop similar to that of the selective condition satements. That is, for the iteration to be initaited,
the condition with the known domain space is evaluated. This is helpful for iterating through loops, 
where the final limit depends on fixed values and not further conditions as shown in while and do-while loops.
